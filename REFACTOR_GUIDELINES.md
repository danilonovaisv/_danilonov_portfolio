- **Identity Preserved**: Maintain the general layout and visual identity.

## Focus Areas

2. **SEO**:
   - Proper metadata.
   - Semantic HTML (h1-h6 hierarchy).
3. **Performance**:
   - Optimization of 3D elements, videos, and images.
   - Lazy loading where appropriate.
4. **Accessibility (a11y)**:
   - ARIA labels.
   - Keyboard navigation.
   - Color contrast conformance.
