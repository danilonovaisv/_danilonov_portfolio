Layout and Grid\n\nThe provided data indicates a sidebar navigation layout, with component categories listed on the side and the main content area displaying the selected component. Detailed information about the grid system is not available.\n\n- **Breakpoints**: Not available in source JSON.\n- **Container widths**: Not available in source JSON.\n- **Number of columns**: Not available in source JSON.\n- **Gaps**: Not available in source JSON.\n\n## 3. Components\n\nThe website is a component library. The primary component detailed is \"Fluid Glass\", but many others are listed in the navigation.\n\n**Component: Fluid Glass**\nAn interactive 3D component that simulates a fluid glass effect.\n\n| Variant / Mode | Key Props / Customization | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `lens` (default) | `scale`, `ior`, `thickness`, `chromaticAberration`, `anisotropy`. Configured via `lensProps`. | Simulates a movable lens effect. |\n| `bar` | Configured via `barProps`, which can include `navItems` array and material properties. | Simulates a glass navigation bar. |\n| `cube` | Configured via `cubeProps`, which includes material and interaction settings. | Simulates a 3D glass cube. |\n\nA comprehensive list of component props is provided:\n\n| Property | Type | Default | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `mode` | string | `'lens'` | Display mode of the fluid glass effect. Options: 'lens', 'bar', 'cube'. |\n| `lensProps` | object | `{}` | Props specific to lens mode including material properties like ior, thickness, transmission. |\n| `barProps` | object | `{}` | Props specific to bar mode including `navItems` array and material properties. |\n| `cubeProps` | object | `{}` | Props specific to cube mode including material properties and interaction settings. |\n\n**Other Listed Components**\nThe sidebar navigation lists numerous other components, grouped by category:\n\n- **Text Animations**: Split Text, Blur Text, Circular Text, Text Type, Shuffle, Shiny Text, and 20 others.\n- **Animations**: Animated Content, Fade Content, Electric Border, Pixel Transition, Glare Hover, and 22 others.\n- **Components**: Animated List, Scroll Stack, Bubble Menu, Magic Bento, Circular Gallery, and 30 others.\n- **Backgrounds**: Liquid Ether, Prism, Dark Veil, Light Pillar, Silk, and 30 others.\n\n## 4. Animations\n\nThe site features a large library of animation-focused components. The \"Fluid Glass\" component is an interactive, real-time 3D animation driven by mouse movement. Traditional animation parameters like duration and easing are not applicable.\n\nA list of components with animation-related functionality is provided in the navigation:\n\n- **Target**: Various UI elements (text, borders, cursors, backgrounds, etc.).\n- **Trigger**: Not specified, but likely includes on-load, on-scroll, on-hover, and on-click based on component names.\n- **Type**: The component names suggest a wide variety of animation types, including WebGL/Three.js effects, hover effects, scroll-based animations, and text effects.\n\nDetailed parameters for each animation are not available in the source JSON.\n\n## 5. Performance\n\nPerformance metrics are not available in the source JSON.\n\n| Metric | Value |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Total page weight | Not available in source JSON. |\n| Core Web Vitals | Not available in source JSON. |\n| Network Requests | Not available in source JSON. |\n\n## 6. Accessibility\n\nAccessibility information is limited in the provided JSON.\n\n- **Landmarks**: Not available in source JSON.\n- **ARIA attributes**: Not available in source JSON.\n- **Focus management**: Not available in source JSON.\n- **Color contrast**: Not available in source JSON.\n- **Alt Text**: Alt text is present for some images (e.g., \"React Bits logo\", \"Star Icon\"). However, several other images have generic alt text (e.g., \"JS\", \"CSS\").\n\n## 7. Technologies and Plugins\n\nThe following technologies are identified from the \"Dependencies\" section and other hints in the content:\n\n| Technology | Type | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| React | Framework | Indicated by the site name \"React Bits\" and library dependencies. |\n| @react-three/fiber | Library | A React renderer for Three.js. |\n| @react-three/drei | Library | A collection of helpers for @react-three/fiber. |\n| three | Library | A 3D graphics library for WebGL. |\n| maath | Library | A math utility library, likely for 3D calculations. |\n| TypeScript | Language | Indicated by a \"TS\" icon. |\n| Tailwind CSS | CSS Framework | Indicated by a \"TW\" icon. |\n\n## 8. SEO, PWA, and HTTP Headers\n\n- **SEO**:\n  - **Meta Title**: \"React Bits - Fluid Glass\" is mentioned as the page title.\n  - Other meta tags and structured data are not available in the source JSON.\n- **PWA**:\n  - Information about a service worker or manifest is not available in the source JSON.\n- **HTTP Headers**:\n  - Information about HTTP headers is not available in the source JSON.\n\n## 9. Forms\n\nTwo forms or form-like structures are identified.\n\n| Form | Field | Type | Required |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Search** | Search Docs | Text Input | Not specified. |\n| **Component Customizer**| Mode | Select/Radio | Not specified. |\n| | Scale | Range Slider | Not specified. |\n| | IOR | Range Slider | Not specified. |\n| | Thickness | Range Slider | Not specified. |\n| | Chromatic Aberration| Range Slider | Not specified. |\n| | Anisotropy | Range Slider | Not specified. |\n\nDetails on validation or submission methods are not available.\n\n## 10. Media\n\nThe following media assets are referenced in the markdown content.\n\n| URL / Path | Format | Alt Text | Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `.../assets/react-bits-logo-BEVRCkxh.svg` | SVG | React Bits logo | Appears twice. |\n| `blob:http://localhost/...` | Not specified | JS | Blob URL, source file not available. |\n| `blob:http://localhost/...` | Not specified | CSS | Blob URL, source file not available. |\n| `blob:http://localhost/...` | Not specified | Star Icon | Blob URL, source file not available. |\n| `blob:http://localhost/...` | Not specified | TS | Blob URL, source file not available. |\n| `blob:http://localhost/...` | Not specified | TW | Blob URL, source file not available. |\n\nOther media attributes like `loading`, `sizes`, or `srcset` are not available in the source JSON.\n\n## Summary\n\n- The website is a component library built with a modern stack including React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with a strong focus on advanced 3D animations using Three.js and React Three Fiber.\n- The \"Fluid Glass\" component is a prime example of the site's offerings: a highly customizable, interactive WebGL component with detailed props for controlling its appearance and behavior.\n- The documentation lists a vast number of components organized into categories like Text Animations, Animations, Components, and Backgrounds.\n- The provided data is heavily focused on the technical implementation and properties of the components, while information regarding design tokens, performance metrics, and detailed accessibility is not available.\n"
