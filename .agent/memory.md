# Project Memory (Active Session Context)

## Current Status

- **Phase:** Design Stabilization & Technical Refinement
- **Focus:** Restoring project customization, configuring agent memory, and ensuring visual fidelity of the "Ghost Era" design.

## Active Tasks

- [x] Restore/Sync `.cursorrules` with `.cursor/rules/*.md` and Workflows.
- [x] Enforce Context & Memory Analysis rule.
- [x] Verify workflow visibility.
- [x] Execute Audit Prompts #01 to #11 (Header, Hero, Menu, Preloader, Manifesto, Ghost, Footer, Portfolio, Featured, Clients, Contact).
- [ ] Maintain the "Ghost/Ethereal" aesthetic in all new code.

## Recent Decisions (Ghost Era)

- **Design:** Shift from "Physical Glass" to "Ethereal/Energy" (Ghost Blue `#0057FF` with high Bloom).
- **Tech:** Next.js 16, Tailwind v4 (Tokens), Lenis Scroll, GSAP for timelines.
- **Workflow:** Use `.agent/workflows` (or `.cursor/workflows`) for complex features.
- **Audit Execution:** Completed `auditoria-home.md` workflow.

## Known Issues / Blockers

- None.

## Next Steps

1. Verify visual details in a browser environment (User Manual Test).
2. Proceed to specific page refinements (e.g., About, Project Details) if requested.
