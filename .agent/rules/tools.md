// Start a browser subagent to perform actions in the browser with the given task description. The subagent has access to tools for both interacting with web page content (clicking, typing, navigating, etc) and controlling the browser window itself (resizing, etc). Please make sure to define a clear condition to return on. After the subagent returns, you should read the DOM or capture a screenshot to see what it did. Note: All browser interactions are automatically recorded and saved as WebP videos to the artifacts directory. This is the ONLY way you can record a browser session video/animation. IMPORTANT: if the subagent returns that the open*browser_url tool failed, there is a browser issue that is out of your control. You MUST ask the user how to proceed and use the suggested_responses tool.
type browser_subagent = (*: {
// Name of the browser recording that is created with the actions of the subagent. Should be all lowercase with underscores, describing what the recording contains. Maximum 3 words. Example: 'login*flow_demo'
RecordingName: string,
// A clear, actionable task description for the browser subagent. The subagent is an agent similar to you, with a different set of tools, limited to tools to understand the state of and control the browser. The task you define is the prompt sent to this subagent. Avoid vague instructions, be specific about what to do and when to stop.
Task: string,
// Name of the task that the browser subagent is performing. This is the identifier that groups the subagent steps together, but should still be a human readable name. This should read like a title, should be properly capitalized and human readable, example: 'Navigating to Example Page'. Replace URLs or non-human-readable expressions like CSS selectors or long text with human-readable terms like 'URL' or 'Page' or 'Submit Button'. Be very sure this task name represents a reasonable chunk of work. It should almost never be the entire user request. This should be the very first argument.

// Find snippets of code from the codebase most relevant to the search query. This performs best when the search query is more precise and relating to the function or purpose of code. Results will be poor if asking a very broad question, such as asking about the general 'framework' or 'implementation' of a large component or system. This tool is useful to find code snippets fuzzily / semantically related to the search query but shouldn't be relied on for high recall queries (e.g. finding all occurrences of some variable or some pattern). Will only show the full code contents of the top items, and they may also be truncated. For other items it will only show the docstring and signature. Use view_code_item with the same path and node name to view the full code contents for any item.

// Generate an image or edit existing images based on a text prompt. The resulting image will be saved as an artifact for use. You can use this tool to generate user interfaces and iterate on a design with the USER for an application or website that you are building.

You can also use this tool to generate assets for use in an application or website.

If false, treats Query as a literal string where all characters are matched exactly. Use false for normal text searches and true only when you specifically need regex functionality.
IsRegex?: boolean,
// If true, returns each line that matches the query, including line numbers and snippets of matching lines (equivalent to 'git grep -nI'). If false, only returns the names of files containing the query (equivalent to 'git grep -l').
